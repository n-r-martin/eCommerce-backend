  <a name="usage"></a>

  ## Usage
  Make sure you create the database first. To do this, login in to MySQL at the root directory and run 'source db/schema.sql'. You can now exit the MySQL shell. Then you'll want to seed the database with starter data by running 'npm run seed' at the root directory. Now you should be able to test your API routes using a tool like Insomia or Postman.
